  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      audtool does not work due to a broken dbus implementation on macOS, so it is not built.
      Core Audio output has been disabled as it does not work (fails to set audio unit input property).
      GTK+ GUI is not built by default as the Qt GUI has better integration with macOS, and the GTK GUI would take precedence if present.
