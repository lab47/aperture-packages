  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      OpenColorIO requires several environment variables to be set.
      You can source the following script in your shell-startup to do that:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/ocio/setup_ocio.sh

      Alternatively the documentation describes what env-variables need set:
        https://opencolorio.org/installation.html#environment-variables

      You will require a config for OCIO to be useful. Sample configuration files
      and reference images can be found at:
        https://opencolorio.org/downloads.html
