  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      If you intend to process AsciiDoc files through an XML stage
      (such as a2x for manpage generation) you need to add something
      like:

        export XML_CATALOG_FILES=#{etc}/xml/catalog

      to your shell rc file so that xmllint can find AsciiDoc's
      catalog files.

      See `man 1 xmllint' for more.
